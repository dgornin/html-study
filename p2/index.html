    <h3 class="inverted_h" id="el">Early life</h3>
    <p>Ye was born on June 8, 1977, in Atlanta, Georgia,[e] as Kanye Omari
         West. After his parents divorced when he was three years old,
          he moved with his mother to Chicago, Illinois.[23][24] His father,
           Ray West, is a former Black Panther and was one of the first black
            photojournalists at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Ray later
             became a Christian counselor,[24] and in 2006, opened the Good Water
              Store and Café in Lexington Park, Maryland, with startup capital
               from his son.[25][26] West's mother, Dr. Donda C. West
                (née Williams),[27] was a professor of English at Clark Atlanta
                 University, and the Chair of the English Department at Chicago
                  State University, before retiring to serve as his manager.

        West was raised in a middle-class environment, attending Polaris School
         for Individual Education[28] in suburban Oak Lawn, Illinois, after
          living in Chicago.[29] At the age of 10, West moved with his mother
           to Nanjing, China, where she was teaching at Nanjing University as
            a Fulbright Scholar.[30] According to his mother, West was the only
             foreigner in his class, but settled in well and quickly picked up
              the language, although he has since forgotten most of it.[31] When
               asked about his grades in high school, West replied, "I got A'sand B's."[32]

        West demonstrated an affinity for the arts at an early age; he began
         writing poetry when he was five years old.[33] His mother recalled that
          she first took notice of West's passion for drawing and music when he
           was in the third grade.[34] West started rapping in the third grade
            and began making musical compositions in the seventh grade,
             eventually selling them to other artists.[35] At age thirteen,
              West wrote a rap song called "Green Eggs and Ham" (the title of
               a best-selling children's book by Dr. Seuss) and persuaded his mother
                to pay for time in a recording studio. Accompanying him to the studio
                 and despite discovering that it was "a little basement studio"
                  where a microphone hung from the ceiling by a wire clothes hanger,
                   West's mother nonetheless supported and encouraged him.[33] West
                    crossed paths with producer/DJ No I.D., with whom he quickly formed
                     a close friendship. No I.D. soon became West's mentor, and it was from
                      him that West learned how to sample and program beats after he received
                       his first sampler at age 15.[36]: 557

        <h3 class="inverted_h" id="fa">Fashion</h3>
        <p>
            Early in his career, West made clear his interest in fashion and desire
             to work in the clothing design industry.[50][108] In September 2005, West
              announced that he would release his Pastelle Clothing line in spring 2006,
               claiming "Now that I have a Grammy under my belt and Late Registration is finished,
                I am ready to launch my clothing line next spring."[287] The line was developed over
                 the following four years—with multiple pieces teased by West himself—before the line
                  was ultimately cancelled in 2009.[288][289] January 2007 saw the release of West’s
                   first sneaker collaborations, a special-edition Bapesta from A Bathing Ape.
                    Unlike subsequent co-branded releases in which West created an entirely new
                     silhouette from the ground up, this joint venture utilized an existing model.
                      The design featured the ”Dropout Bear" mascot from The College Dropout, on
                       the heel, as well as using the brown, orange, and tan color scheme that appeared
                        on the cover of the aformentiated album.[290][291]
        </p>
        <h3 class="inverted_h" id="bv">Business ventures</h3>
        <p>West founded the record label and production company GOOD Music in 2004, in conjunction
             with Sony BMG, shortly after releasing his debut album, The College Dropout. West,
              alongside then-unknown Ohio singer John Legend and fellow Chicago rapper Common
               were the label's inaugural artists.[322] The label houses artists including West,
                Big Sean, Pusha T, Teyana Taylor, Yasiin Bey / Mos Def, D'banj and John Legend, and
                 producers including Hudson Mohawke, Q-Tip, Travis Scott, No I.D., Jeff Bhasker, and S1.
                  GOOD Music has released ten albums certified gold or higher by the Recording Industry
                   Association of America (RIAA). In November 2015, West appointed Pusha T the new president
                    of GOOD Music.[323]</p>
        <h3 class="inverted_h" id="ph">Philanthropy</h3>
        <p>West, alongside his mother, founded the "Kanye West Foundation" in Chicago in 2003, tasked with
             a mission to battle dropout and illiteracy rates, while partnering with community organizations
              to provide underprivileged youth access to music education.[343] In 2007, West and the Foundation
               partnered with Strong American Schools as part of their "Ed in '08" campaign.[344][345] As spokesman
                for the campaign, West appeared in a series of PSAs for the organization, and hosted an inaugural
                 benefit concert in August of that year.[346]</p>
        <h3 class="inverted_h" id="ac">Acting and filmmaking</h3>
        <p>West made cameo appearances as himself in the films State Property 2 (2005) and The Love Guru (2008),[353][354]
             and in an episode of the television show Entourage in 2007.[355] West provided the voice for "Kenny West",
              a rapper, in the animated sitcom The Cleveland Show.[354] In 2009, he starred in the Spike Jonze-directed
               short film We Were Once a Fairytale (2009), playing himself acting belligerently while drunk in a nightclub.[356]
                West wrote, directed, and starred in the musical short film Runaway (2010), which heavily features music
                 from My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.[100] The film depicts a relationship between a man, played by West,
                  and a half-woman, half-phoenix creature.[357]</p>
